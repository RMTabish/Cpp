# C++ Tasks Collection

This repository contains a variety of small C++ programming tasks that I have completed. These tasks cover basic to intermediate concepts and are designed to reinforce understanding of C++ syntax, algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving approaches.

## Contents

The repository is organized into individual folders or files representing each task, which cover topics such as:

- **Basic Syntax**: Tasks that focus on understanding and using C++ syntax, data types, and control structures.
- **Functions**: A collection of tasks demonstrating the use of functions, parameters, and return values.
- **Loops and Conditionals**: Examples of for, while loops, and conditional statements.
- **Arrays and Strings**: Basic operations with arrays and strings.
- **Pointers and References**: Exercises focusing on pointer usage and reference types.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Small projects illustrating classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **STL (Standard Template Library)**: Usage of vectors, maps, and other STL containers.

## How to Use

Each task can be run independently. Simply clone the repository and navigate to the folder containing the task you want to explore.

To compile and run any task:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
